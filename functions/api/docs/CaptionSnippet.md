## Example

```python
from youtube_data_v3.models.caption_snippet import CaptionSnippet

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of CaptionSnippet from a JSON string
caption_snippet_instance = CaptionSnippet.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print CaptionSnippet.to_json()

# convert the object into a dict
caption_snippet_dict = caption_snippet_instance.to_dict()
